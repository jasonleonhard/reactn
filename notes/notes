script and link tags for react and JSXTransformer OR
  JSXTrasformer is great for development, but react-tools for production.... so just preprocess all css...otherwise you will have to 
use npm or bower and load in that way...
  sudo npm install -g react-tools # module to not require jsx but just old js

use pserver & localhost:8000
create html
  must have 
    <div id='react-container'></div>
  can have 
    inline script like this
      <script type="text/jsx"> anything to react here </script>
    or external js/Note.js file like this 
      <script src="js/Note.js" type="text/jsx" ></script> 
      Template.js is great example of how to start

consider 
  adding custom css...
  npm init






build ( React.createElement("div", null, ... )-> js
  helloworld.js
src ( <div>.... )
  helloworld.js
index





Serve .html with firefox localhost, pserver, or gulp
gulp
