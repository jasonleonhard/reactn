script and link tags for react and JSXTransformer OR
  JSXTrasformer is great for development, but react-tools for production.... so just preprocess all css...otherwise you will have to 
use npm or bower and load in that way...
  sudo npm install -g react-tools # module to not require jsx but just old js

use pserver & localhost:8000
create html
  must have 
    <div id='react-container'></div>
  can have 
    inline script like this
      <script type="text/jsx"> anything to react here </script>
    or external js/Note.js file like this 
      <script src="js/Note.js" type="text/jsx" ></script> 
      Template.js is great example of how to start

consider 
  adding custom css...
  npm init






build ( React.createElement("div", null, ... )-> js
  helloworld.js
src ( <div>.... )
  helloworld.js
index





Serve .html with firefox localhost, pserver, or gulp
gulp

Component Life Cycle: Mounting
  getDefaultProps     called once and set props
  getInitialState     called once and set state
  componentWillMount  last chance to affect state before render
  render              only req method
  componentDidMount   after successful mount, can now access DOM

Component Life Cycle: Update
  componentWillReceiveProps can change object and update state  
  shouldComponentUpdate     invoked right before render, often to inhance preformance
  componentWillUpdate       ditto
  render                    can use to update component
  componentDidUpdate        after all updates

Component Life Cycle: Unmounting
  componentWillUnmount      can clean up DOM elements, invalidate timers, 
                            can call on parent to unmount children
