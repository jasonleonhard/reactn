JSXTrasformer is great for development, but react-tools for production.... so just preprocess all css...
otherwise you will have to 

sudo npm install -g react-tools # module to not require jsx but just old js

build ( React.createElement("div", null, ... )-> js
  helloworld.js
src ( <div>.... )
  helloworld.js
index





Serve .html with firefox localhost, pserver, or gulp
gulp
